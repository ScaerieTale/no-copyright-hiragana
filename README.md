# No Copyright Hiragana for Everyone!

## Copyright free images of the Japanese Hiragana alphabet

FAQ:

### Q: Are these really copyright free?

A: Yes! 100%. They're every Hiragana character I could find (Including the ones considered "obsolete", for educational and historical purposes). You're free to use them however you want. You don't have to credit me, but if you do use them in a public project, I'd love to know/see it!

### Are you a native Japanese speaker?

A: Nope! I'm actually just learning the language myself. That's why I created this project. I couldn't find any really good sources of flash cards for my own, personal use, that didn't involve sifting through all the Hiragana I didn't know yet to find the ones I did. So, I made my own.

## WHhat's in this repository?

UPDATE: 3/28 - I've added more vocabulary cards and reorganized the "Words" folder into parts of speech, concepts (Numbers, Colors) and Conversatinal (Hello, goodbye, Yes, No).

Insidhe this repo you'll find "Syllables" and "Words" directories. Each two (Ni, „Å´, 2) subfolders (with "Words" divided as mentioned in the 3/28 update)

- The "Backgrounds" subfolder contains Hiragana in black, on a white background.
- The "Transparent" subfolder contains Hiragana on a transparent background.
  The "Words" subfolder shares a similar structure, but is currently empty. As I created this repositiory as a learning resource for myself in addition to anyone else who wishes to use it, I'll be adding to the vocabulary list as I learn them myself, so, expect steady progress!

HOWEVER, I do have diagnosed ADHD which is why I've included transparent copies. If you'd like, you can create your own flash cards from these images, or use the Japanese Hiragana Online Keyboard (See Credits below) to create your own!

This is a labor of love, and I expect nothing in return. You're more than welcome to credit me if you do use these, and please let me know if you do. I'd love to see what you create!

### Are you going to make a no copyright Katakana/Kanji?

A: Yes, eventually! Right now I'm focused on learning and mastering hiragana, but I want to learn katakana and Kanji as well.

### Hey, you forgot one!

A: That's entirely likely. I already found one that I missed just today after uploading this project last night. If you see a missing character, please feel free to ach out to me either on Twitter @ScaerieTale, Mastadon @ScaerieTale@Tech.lgbt or via gmail (I'll give you three guesses what my gmail address is!)
