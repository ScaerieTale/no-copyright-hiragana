## Copyright free images of the Japanese Hiragana alphabet
I'll be honest.  I couldn't find any good resources for free, no copyright, easy-to-use hiragana flash cards so I decided to just make my own!  If you spot any inconsistencies, incorrectly named files, etc. please reach out to me on Twitter @ScaerieTale, or @ gmail.com (same name) to let me know.

I am NOT a native speaker.  In fact, that's the reason for this side-project. :)

##Usage and Details
To download, just click that big green "Code" button in the top right, and in the dropdown menu, select Download as ZIP' at the bottom.  The files are all in .PNG format, 400x400 pixels, and you should be able to resize them in any half decent image editing software without any issues.

## CREDITS:
https://www.lexilogos.com/keyboard/hiragana.htm for their fantastic Japanese Hiragana keyboard, from which I tediously copy-and-pasted every single character :)
