## Copyright free images of the Japanese Hiragana alphabet
I'll be honest.  I couldn't find any good resources for free, no copyright, easy-to-use hiragana flash cards so I decided to just make my own!  If you spot any inconsistencies, incorrectly named files, etc. please reach out to me on Twitter @ScaerieTale, or @ gmail.com (same name) to let me know.

I am NOT a native speaker.  In fact, that's the reason for this side-project. :)
